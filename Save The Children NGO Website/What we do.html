					<b>Save the Children fights for the right of children to have a future.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In Save the Children we believe that all children and adolescents deserve to have a decent present and future. In South Africa and around the world, we work every day to give children a good start in life, as well as the opportunity to learn and be protected from violence or any other damage.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We make sure that they meet their specific needs and that their voices are heard. We achieve lasting results for millions of children and adolescents, including those who are more difficult to reach.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Global Strategy: Ambition for Children</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In 2015, the Save the Children movement agreed a new global strategy - Ambition for Children 2030. We also published a strategic plan for 2016-2018. Through this strategy, we will harness our resources, energy, knowledge and expertise to drive our three global breakthroughs for 2030:

				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b><i style="color:red">Learn</i>:</b> all children learn from a good quality basic education.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b ><i style="color:red">Be protected</i>:</b> violence against children is no longer tolerated.
