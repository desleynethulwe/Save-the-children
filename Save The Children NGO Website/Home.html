				<h1>Why Save The Children</h1>
				<p>	
					Save the Children was the first global movement for children, boldly declaring that children have rights. Today, we champion the rights of the world’s 2.3 billion children. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It is because of our commitment to children that Save the Children has garnered top ratings among other nonprofit organizations. Charity watch groups give us top ratings for achieving incredible results for children – with a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					In 2021, we reached more than 183 million children, including 837,000 here in the United States.
