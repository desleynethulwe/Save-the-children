						<p>
							<b>“Change is within reach – if we have courage, determination, imagination and effective organisation” -Eglantyne Jebb-</b>
						</p>
						 
						<p>
							The story of Save the Children is one of hope and deeply passionate and committed people, determined to make the world a better place for all our children.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							It began with one woman who changed the world’s response to children in need.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>19 May 1919:</b> Eglantyne Jebb launched a worldwide movement - the Save the Children Fund. She was driven by the belief that all children have the right to a healthy, happy and fulfilling life.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>1923:</b> Jebb drafted the first Declaration of the Rights of the Child - one of the central inspirations for the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is also our foundation to continue Eglantyne Jebb’s work - long-term improvement of children’s lives and the realisation of their rights.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>1944:</b> Save the Children started their work in South Africa with children and their families in some of the most marginalised communities.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>2013:</b> A proudly South African entity was formed - Save the Children South Africa – to fight for local children’s rights. <b>Save the Children South Africa</b> became an official member of Save the Children International thanks to the merger of Save the Children Gauteng, Save the Children KwaZulu-Natal, Save the Children UK and Savethe Children Sweden.
						</p>
						
						
						
						 <h1 class="page-title">Where We work</h1>
						 
						<p>
							<b>As a global movement, operating in over 120 countries, last year the Save the Children movement directly reached 56.3 million children.</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In South Africa, we work across five provinces – Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Free State, Limpopo and KwaZulu- Natal, and our programmes have supported 66,826 children directly this year. In addition, we meaningfully engaged with children’s families and broader support systems and so, 83,437 people in total benefited from our programmes.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our staff are experts providing practical support in the field to children, creating impacts at scale
						</p>
						 
						<h1 class="page-title">OUR SUCCESSES</h1>
						<p>
							<b>With the generosity of thousands of South Africans, we work hard to protect children from harm and help them access quality education and health services.</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							With more than 65 years working with children, we are at the forefront of saving children’s lives and creating lasting change for children and their families through our long-term development programs.   
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Watch our videos, view images and read stories from those who are benefiting from our programs in South Africa.  
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<b>We can’t do it on our own. Do something amazing! Become involved. Your donations will change lives forever.</b>
						</p>
						
						<h1 class="page-title">OUR PEOPLE</h1>
						<p>
							<b>DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our vision is a world where every child survives, learns and is protected. We aim to inspire breakthroughs in the way the world treats children, for immediate and lasting change in their lives.
						
						</p>
						<h1 class="page-title">ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY</h1>
						<p>
							<b>OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN SURVIVE, LEARN AND ARE PROTECTED BY DELIVERING EVIDENCE-BASED, HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMMES.</b>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We want to implement these programmes in as many Provinces as we can so that no child is left behind.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our success depends on empowering our people and partners to deliver their best by providing them with best-practice systems, processes and support. In particular, our programmes and advocacy efforts need to be informed by rigorous research and evaluation.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We constantly look for ways to improve our accountability and transparency practices. Browse this section of our website for more information.
